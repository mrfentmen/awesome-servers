# Chess

Use this MCP server to chess.com. Player profiles, ratings, game archives, leaderboards, and titled players.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

The server uses stdio, so it can be connected to Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, MCP Inspector, or another compatible MCP client.

## Tools at a glance

- `get_player`: Get a chess.com player profile.
- `get_player_stats`: Get a player
- `get_player_games`: Get a player
- `get_leaderboards`: Top players on chess.com by rating.
- `get_titled_players`: List players with a title like GM or IM.

## Limits and privacy

This project is intentionally narrow. It should be treated as a practical helper, not a complete certification or security audit. Check the implementation and the returned data before using it with sensitive material. No credentials are required unless the project explicitly says otherwise.

## Try it

After building, connect the server through your MCP client. The repository root also contains `smoke-test.mjs` for projects covered by the shared harness. A typical tool call starts with `get_player`.

## Premium tools

These tools need a licence key:

* `live_leaderboards`
* `board_records`

The tool bodies run on our gateway, not inside this package, so the key is what buys access. Buy one at https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_mrO7rS5LZxpqM7oAFFEA10i9121J240U40IIj4JRZO4 and set it in your MCP client config:

```json
"env": { "MCP_LICENSE_KEY": "polar_..." }
```

The gateway checks the key against Polar and gives every key 1,000 free premium
calls a month before per-call billing starts. Every other tool on this server
stays free.
